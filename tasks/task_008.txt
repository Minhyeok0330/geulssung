# Status: pending

# Description: Implement user profile page showing user's posts, received feedback, and reaction history.
# Details:
1. Create user profile endpoints:
   - Get user profile details
   - Get user's posts
   - Get user's feedback history
   - Get user's reaction history (likes given, authors followed)

2. Implement profile update functionality:
   - Update nickname
   - Change password
   - Update profile settings (optional)

3. Add aggregated statistics:
   - Average scores (political, gender, neutrality)
   - Post count by depth (original, rebuttal, counter-rebuttal)
   - Reaction counts received

API Endpoints:
- GET /api/users/:id/profile
- GET /api/users/:id/posts
- GET /api/users/:id/feedback
- GET /api/users/:id/reactions
- GET /api/users/:id/stats
- PUT /api/users/:id/profile
- PUT /api/users/:id/password

# Test Strategy:
1. Test profile retrieval with valid and invalid user IDs
2. Verify post history retrieval
3. Test feedback history aggregation
4. Validate reaction history retrieval
5. Test profile updates
6. Verify password change functionality
7. Test statistics calculation accuracy
