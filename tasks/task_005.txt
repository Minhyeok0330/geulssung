# Task ID: 5
# Title: Post Creation and Tree Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the post creation system with tree structure for original posts, rebuttals, and counter-rebuttals.
# Details:
1. Create Post model with Sequelize/TypeORM/Prisma
2. Implement post creation endpoint:
   - Validate user authentication
   - Store post content, topic, author
   - Handle parent_post_id for rebuttals
   - Enforce depth limit (max 2 levels deep)
   - Validate that counter-rebuttals can only be made by original post author

3. Implement post retrieval endpoints:
   - Get post by ID
   - Get posts by topic
   - Get posts by user
   - Get post tree (original + rebuttals + counter-rebuttals)

4. Add pagination and sorting options

API Endpoints:
- POST /api/posts
- GET /api/posts
- GET /api/posts/:id
- GET /api/posts/topic/:topicId
- GET /api/posts/user/:userId
- GET /api/posts/:id/tree

# Test Strategy:
1. Test post creation with valid and invalid inputs
2. Verify depth constraints (max 2 levels)
3. Test that counter-rebuttals can only be made by original author
4. Validate post retrieval by different criteria
5. Test tree structure retrieval
6. Verify pagination and sorting functionality
