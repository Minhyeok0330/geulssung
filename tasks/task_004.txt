# Task ID: 4
# Title: Topic Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the system for managing news/issue topics that will serve as writing prompts for users.
# Details:
1. Create Topic model with Sequelize/TypeORM/Prisma
2. Implement admin-only topic creation endpoint:
   - Add keyword
   - Add description
   - Set active status

3. Implement topic listing endpoints:
   - Get all topics
   - Get today's active topic
   - Get topic by ID

4. Create simple admin interface for topic management (optional for MVP)

API Endpoints:
- POST /api/topics (admin only)
- GET /api/topics
- GET /api/topics/today
- GET /api/topics/:id
- PUT /api/topics/:id (admin only)
- DELETE /api/topics/:id (admin only)

# Test Strategy:
1. Test topic creation with valid and invalid inputs
2. Verify admin-only access for creation/update/delete
3. Test retrieval of today's topic
4. Validate topic listing functionality
5. Test topic update and deletion
