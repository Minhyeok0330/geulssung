# Task ID: 7
# Title: Reaction System (Likes and Follows)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the reaction system allowing users to like posts and follow authors.
# Details:
1. Create Reaction model with Sequelize/TypeORM/Prisma
2. Implement reaction endpoints:
   - Like/unlike a post
   - Follow/unfollow an author
   - Get likes for a post
   - Get followers for an author
   - Get posts liked by a user
   - Get authors followed by a user

3. Add reaction counts to post and user responses

API Endpoints:
- POST /api/reactions/like/:postId
- DELETE /api/reactions/like/:postId
- POST /api/reactions/follow/:authorId
- DELETE /api/reactions/follow/:authorId
- GET /api/posts/:id/likes
- GET /api/users/:id/followers
- GET /api/users/:id/following
- GET /api/users/:id/liked-posts

# Test Strategy:
1. Test like/unlike functionality
2. Test follow/unfollow functionality
3. Verify reaction counts are accurate
4. Test retrieving likes and follows
5. Validate that users cannot like their own posts
6. Test concurrent reactions from multiple users
