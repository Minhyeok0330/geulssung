# Task ID: 6
# Title: AI Feedback Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate with OpenAI GPT API to analyze posts and provide feedback on political leaning, gender bias, and neutrality.
# Details:
1. Create Feedback model with Sequelize/TypeORM/Prisma
2. Implement OpenAI GPT integration service:
   - Configure API key and model selection
   - Create prompt template for analyzing posts
   - Parse response to extract scores and feedback

3. Create feedback generation endpoint:
   - Trigger on post creation
   - Send post content to GPT API
   - Parse response and store feedback
   - Calculate political_score, gender_score, and neutrality

4. Implement feedback retrieval endpoints:
   - Get feedback by post ID
   - Include feedback in post details

Prompt template example:
```
Analyze the following text for political leaning (0-100, where 0 is far-left, 50 is neutral, 100 is far-right), gender bias (0-100, where 0 is strongly female-biased, 50 is neutral, 100 is strongly male-biased), and overall neutrality (0-100, where 0 is highly biased, 100 is completely neutral).

Text: "{{post_content}}"

Provide scores and brief explanation in JSON format:
{
  "political_score": number,
  "gender_score": number,
  "neutrality": number,
  "explanation": string
}
```

API Endpoints:
- POST /api/posts/:id/feedback (internal use)
- GET /api/posts/:id/feedback

# Test Strategy:
1. Test GPT API integration with sample posts
2. Verify score calculation and normalization
3. Test feedback storage and retrieval
4. Validate error handling for API failures
5. Test performance and response times
6. Verify feedback is generated automatically on post creation
